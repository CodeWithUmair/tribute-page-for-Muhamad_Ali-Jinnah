            <p>“I do not believe in taking the right decision, I take a decision and make it right.”</p>

                ― Muhammad Ali Jinnah

            <p>“Think a hundred times before you take a decision, but once that decision is taken, stand by it as one man.”</p>

                ― Muhammad Ali Jinnah

            <p>“There are two powers in the world; one is the sword and the other is the pen. There is a great competition and rivalry between the two. There is a third power stronger than both, that of the women.”</p>

                ― Muhammad Ali Jinnah

            <p>“Expect the best, prepare for the worst.”</p>

                ― Muhammad Ali Jinnah

            <p>“Democracy is in the blood of the Muslims, who look upon complete equality of mankind, and believe in fraternity, equality, and liberty.”</p>


                ― Muhammad Ali Jinnah
            <p>“No nation can rise to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you. We are victims of evil customs. It is a crime against humanity that our women are shut up within the four walls of the houses as prisoners. There is no sanction anywhere for the deplorable condition in which our women have to live.”</p>

                ― Muhammad Ali Jinnah
